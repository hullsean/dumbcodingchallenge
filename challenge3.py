# challenge #3

# This one is pretty straightforward.
# hopefully you know that array elements are numbered
# starting from 0.  So the first letter "I" is myString[0]
# so 4 & 5 respectively at "ke"

# pretty basic, no weird syntax trickery
#

import sys

def main():

  myString = "I like to test"

  print (myString[0] + myString[4] + myString[5])

  return 0

main()
